# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a Java-based project designed to efficiently manage and organize library resources, making it easier for librarians to maintain records and for users to access books and other materials.

## Introduction

The Library Management System was developed to streamline the operations of libraries and improve user experience. It helps librarians manage their collection, keep track of borrowed and returned items, and provide a user-friendly interface for patrons to search for books, check availability, and make requests.

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure login and authentication system for both librarians and patrons.
- Book Catalog: Maintain a comprehensive catalog of books, including title, author, genre, and availability status.
- Borrowing and Returning: Allow users to borrow and return books, with due date reminders.
- Search and Browse: Easy search and browsing options for users to find books in the library.
- Request System: Patrons can request books, and librarians can approve or deny requests.
